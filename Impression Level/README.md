## Impression Evidence Level

This folder contains each stage of the first impression evidence level of Forensics Pursuit.
Note that only the evidence collection stage has comments inside and is cleaned up. 
In the future, comments will be added to the lab and testimony levels.

If you would like to have a copy of these games on your own computer to modify, you will need to copy the stage's folder into the
folder where your ren'py games are stored (the default is usually called renpy projects on Windows).

Please reach out to Janna if you have any questions regarding the impression level or duplicating a copy onto your laptop.
