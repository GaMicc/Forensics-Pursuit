## Game Play
### Crime Scene 1
There is a shoeprint on the floor of the living room. There are two objects, a vase and a bottle on the living room table that can be collected. The player should be suspicious that there is no blood visible and use ALS to locate blood on the wall as well as retrieving a sample. The player is prompted to do the presumptive test, which is the Kestle Meyer Test to evaluate if the blood splatter is real blood. The player is free to collect the evidence in any order.
### Lab Scene 1
The alcohol bottle has both fingerprint and substance inside. The player should process the fingerprint using granular dusting and pipette the substance into a Gas Chromatography Headspace instrument to identify the substance. The vase has a red substance on it, and since the presumptive test was already done in the crime scene, the player is provided that the red substance is indeed blood. The player is prompted to swab the vase first before processing it in the Cyanosafe Chamber for fingerprint enhancement. The player should then develop the vase in the wetlab for further fingerprint examination and photograph the fingerprint. The player should be left with two blood swabs, from the wall in the crime scene and the new swab from the vase. The player should send this off to the bio lab and get two DNA sample profiles in return. 
The player should complete the materials lab and obtain the DNA profiles and fingerprints before proceeding onto the data analysis lab. However, they are not restricted to skipping ahead. 
The player is to import their DNA and fingerprints and identify the best match. Upon getting the best match, more information is revealed.
