# Kidnapping at Robarts Game Level - Vivian Song

## Description

The files contained within this folder contain code for a Forensics Pursuit level based on the below scenario. The code structure itself is based on Nina's Level 1 Prototype. This level aims to evaluate the following forensics science concepts:

* Securing path of contamination 
* Finding latent evidence 
* Polyvinylsiloxane for pry/tool marks
* 2D Non-porous fingerprint development using TapeGlo
* 2D Non-porous fingerprint development using Camphor Smoke

## Scenario
A female student went missing a couple days ago and was last seen at Robarts Library, specifically in the Robarts Commons. Witnesses close to the student were asked to come in for questioning and sources close to the student claim the student was staying late studying for a chemistry exam and never returned home nor showed up for their exam.

# Robarts Theft Game Level - Vivian Song

## Description

The files contained within this folder contain code for a Forensics Pursuit level based on the below scenario. The code structure itself is based on Nina's Level 1 Prototype. This level aims to evaluate the following forensics science concepts:

* Path of contamination 
* Finding latent evidence 
* Oblique lighting 
* 2D Footprint development  
* 2D Non-porous fingerprint development

## Scenario
A rare and valuable manuscript has been stolen from the second floor of the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library during a sophisticated heist that took place last night. The thief was able to hijack the security system, however, a couple witnesses who were closeby at the time of the theft were able to snap a couple pictures of the thief as he fled the scene.
