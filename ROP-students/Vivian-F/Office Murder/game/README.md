# Vivian F. Level 1: Office Murder

This folder contains code to the partner created scene for level 1 (with Kathryn).  All code contained in the “game” folder, in which all folders and its contents except “images” and RenPy codes out of folders were default RenPy data.

## Scenario
The scenario is murder in the Bahen Centre. Criminal had entered Bahen midnight and broke through the library front door in reach for the donor cheques kept in the office space. The inexperienced criminal was carrying a gun and was suddenly met with the building security. Security was soon after shot and killed by the panicking criminal. The perpetrator left the scene within a couple minutes and tried his best to clean up, but he was in a hurry. Player's job now is to analyze the scene and collect evidence to find him.
