# Scenario: Trespassing Gone Wrong
## Overview of Scenario:
A neighbour reported seeing someone entering the abandoned house nextdoor. When police arrive at the house, they find nobody but notice the door is unlocked. Upon entering the house, they find human skeletal remains along with a gun and some used syringes, evidence that someone is currently living there. Your job is to collect all the available forensic evidence to help solve this potential homicide.

## What is Currently Completed:
- The section of the game involving collecting evidence outside, including:
  - Collecting the footprints left in nearby soil
  - Collecting a fingerprint left on the door of the house

## What Needs to be Developed:
1. Collecting evidence inside of the house, including:
   - Collecting the human skeletal remains that will be behind the couch
   - Collecting the gun on the table
   - Collecting the 2 used syringes that are also on the table
   - Allowing the player to investigate the couch and collect a strand of hair off it
   - Allowing the player to look through drawers in a dresser for any evidence
2. Bug fixes:
   - Fixing bug where toolbox visually disappears after placing evidence marker by the footprints (you currently need to click where the toolbox is to make it reappear)
