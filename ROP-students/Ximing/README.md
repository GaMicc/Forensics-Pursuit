Scene: 2D fingerprints and secondary scenes
In this crime scenario, the player investigates a nighttime break at a jewelry store where several necklaces have been stolen. The player navigates both the interior and exterior of the store, collecting crucial evidence such as fingerprints on a stone used to break in and a discarded beer bottle outside the store. Inside, the player can find non-essential clues, such as fingerprints on the cashier counter belonging to the store owner.
