### Timer instructions:
There are three things in the folder that you need to add:
1. **timer.rpy**  - no modifications need to be made to this file.
2. **script_addon.rpy** - siphon the code from this file into your actual script.rpy after the code block you want to use it with. I included TODOs for everything you need to modify to get it to work.
3. **timer_pictures** - a file folder with images for the UI.

TODO:
- Toolmark evidence colllection with plaster instead of just a picture
- Make it take a picture for each scene of the crime
- Clean up/redesign the report collection at the end
