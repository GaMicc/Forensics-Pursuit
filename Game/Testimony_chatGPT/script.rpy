One witness claims to have called a drug dealer, Edward Bartlett, on the night of the party. Edward is also the accused on trial, as some witnesses identified him as the individual who attacked Ezra in a lineup."

Kiernan had been reported absent from work and was not at home around the time of Jacob's death. Furthermore, Kiernan's car was discovered near the lake where the body was found. The investigation has been complicated by the lack of direct witnesses and evidence of forced entry into the home."
