Forensics Pursuit is a collection of forensics games, developed to educate forensics students on crime scene analysis.
This collection comprises engaging and comprehensive levels that delve into the intricacies of forensic evidence collection and processing. In particular, students will explore the critical steps in forensic investigations, starting with **evidence collection**, **laboratory processing**, and ultimately, **courtroom testimonies**. Our goal is for students to develop a deep understanding of how forensic science plays a pivotal role in solving crimes and delivering justice! 

The games are developed using Ren'Py, a visual novel engine that runs on Python.
