# Forensics Pursuit

Forensics Pursuit is a collection of forensics games, developed to educate forensics students on the process of crime scene analysis. This collection comprises of engaging and comprehensive levels that delve into the intricacies of forensic evidence collection and processing. In particular, students will get to explore the critical steps involved in forensic investigations, starting with evidence collection, followed by laboratory processing and ultimately, courtroom testimonies. Our goal is for students to develop a deep understanding of how forensic science plays a pivotal role in solving crimes and delivering justice! 

The games are developed using Ren'Py, a visual novel engine that runs on the programming language Python.
