## UI Assets

This folder consists of image assets that may be useful during game development to maintain consistency across the different games we each create.<br/>

Note: These elements are constantly undergoing redesign, so please monitor this subfolder every so often! 🛠️


### Directory Guide
There are currently three subdirectories in the directory outlined below. Please review the README's of each folder on how to use these assets. 
- `Gameplay Elements`: Custom gameplay sprites (ex. toolbox, timer, oven) to be imported into the game.
- `Previous Versions`: Previous assets that may no longer be needed, but a copy is kept just in case. 
- `UI Elements`: Custom UI sprites (ex. character, dialogue boxes) to be imported into the game.
  
### Suggestions
We are always looking to improve upon our design, so please contact Nina or set up an issue if you have suggestions for any changes! 💬
